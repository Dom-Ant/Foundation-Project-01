            <p class="paragraph MJ-p"> His biography on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website
                states:
                <strong>"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."</strong> He
                played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning 6 NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls. He was integral in
                popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global cultural icon in the
                process.
                MJ joined the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star,
                entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's best
                defensive players. His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free-throw line
                in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness". Jordan won his first NBA
                title with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a
                three-peat. Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League
                Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997,
                and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for the
                second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the
                Washington Wizards. During the course of his professional career he was also selected to play for the
                United States national team, winning four gold medals (at the 1983 Pan American Games, 1984 Summer
                Olympics, 1992 Tournament of the Americas and 1992 Summer Olympics), while also being undefeated.
