    <h1 class="title">The history of basketball</h1>
    <p>The invention of basketball is accredited to James Naismith, in 1891 Springfield, Massachusetts. Working as a physical instructor at the YMCA International Training School, he devised a game to that athletes could play indoors during the cold winter months to keep in shape. Initially peach baskets were nailed to lower rafters and the game had to be stopped everytime there was a goal for the janitor to retrieve the ball, but evenetually the bottom of the baskets were removed. </p>
